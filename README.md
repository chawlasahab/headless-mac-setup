# üñ•Ô∏è Headless Mac Setup (2025 Edition)

Turn any Mac into a 24x7 **headless machine** you can control remotely ‚Äî with the lid closed and no display connected.

This guide walks you through making your Mac accessible via SSH, Screen Sharing, and keeps it awake using `caffeinate`, even when the lid is shut.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- A Mac with macOS Ventura or later
- Access to another Mac to control it remotely
- Local Wi-Fi or Ethernet network

---

## üö´ Step 1: Prevent Mac From Sleeping (Lid Closed)

macOS sleeps when the lid closes. We'll override that with a background process.

### ‚úÖ Use `caffeinate` (built-in, no install required)

```bash
nohup caffeinate -dimsu > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

But this is temporary ‚Äî it dies after logout/reboot.

---

## üîÅ Step 2: Auto-Start `caffeinate` on Boot (LaunchDaemon)

We'll create a system-wide LaunchDaemon so your Mac stays awake even without logging into the GUI or using VNC.

### Option A: Use the included `.plist` file

Download or copy `com.headless.caffeinate.plist` into `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` with the following:

```bash
sudo cp com.headless.caffeinate.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/
sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.headless.caffeinate.plist
sudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.headless.caffeinate.plist
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.headless.caffeinate.plist
```

### Option B: Create the file manually (if not using the repo copy)

```bash
sudo nano /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.headless.caffeinate.plist
```

Paste this content:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"
 "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.headless.caffeinate</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/usr/bin/caffeinate</string>
        <string>-dimsu</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Then load it:

```bash
sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.headless.caffeinate.plist
sudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.headless.caffeinate.plist
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.headless.caffeinate.plist
```

## üåê Step 3: Enable Remote Access

### A. Screen Sharing

- Go to `System Settings > General > Sharing`
- Enable **Screen Sharing**
- Connect from another Mac:
  ```
  vnc://your-mac-hostname.local
  ```
  or
  ```
  vnc://your-mac-ip
  ```

### B. Remote Login (SSH)

- Also in Sharing, enable **Remote Login**
- Connect from another device:
  ```bash
  ssh your-username@your-mac-hostname.local
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  ssh your-username@your-mac-ip
  ```

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Step 4: Enable File Sharing (Optional)

- Go to **System Settings > Sharing > File Sharing**
- Add folders you want accessible (e.g., `Downloads`, `Documents`)
- Access it from another Mac:
  ```
  smb://your-mac-hostname.local
  ```
  or
  ```
  smb://your-mac-ip
  ```

---

## ‚úÖ Done! Your Mac is Now Headless & Remote-Ready

- ‚úÖ Stays awake 24x7 with lid closed
- ‚úÖ Accessible via Screen Sharing and SSH
- ‚úÖ Ready for file transfers

---

## üß† Bonus (Advanced)

### üîë Set up SSH key login (from controller Mac to headless Mac)

To enable passwordless SSH login from your **controller Mac** to your **headless Mac**, follow these steps:

#### 1. Generate a new SSH key (on controller Mac)

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "headless-mac" -f ~/.ssh/headless-mac
```

This creates:
- `~/.ssh/headless-mac` (private key)
- `~/.ssh/headless-mac.pub` (public key)

#### 2. Copy the key to the headless Mac

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/headless-mac.pub your-username@your-headless-mac-ip
```

Or with hostname:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/headless-mac.pub your-username@your-headless-mac-hostname.local
```

> üí° Replace `your-username` with your user account **on the headless Mac**.

#### 3. Test SSH login

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/headless-mac your-username@your-headless-mac-ip
```

‚úÖ You should be able to log in without entering a password.

#### 4. (Optional) Add to SSH config for convenience

```bash
nano ~/.ssh/config
```

Add this block:

```ssh
Host headless-mac
    HostName your-headless-mac-ip
    User your-username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/headless-mac
```

Now you can simply connect with:

```bash
ssh headless-mac
```

#### 5. (Optional) Store passphrase in macOS Keychain

If you entered a passphrase while generating the key and want macOS to remember it:

```bash
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/headless-mac
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/headless-mac
```
